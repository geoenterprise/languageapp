# Overview

This mobile app was created as part of my journey to become a better software engineer and mobile developer. The goal was to build a real-world, interactive Android application that helps language learners engage in Project-Based Learning (PBL), combining writing practice with pronunciation and instant AI feedback.

The app allows users to:
- Write short English responses to project-based prompts (like community improvement ideas).
- Record their voice to practice pronunciation.
- Get real-time writing feedback from an AI assistant (using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API).
- Store and retrieve their answers with a Room database, even after the app is closed.

This is not a simple vocabulary app â€” it simulates real-world English tasks in a learner-centered way. My purpose is to expand this into a modern language learning tool with creative, project-based engagement and personalized AI feedback.
